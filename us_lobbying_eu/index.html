      <h1>How transparent is US influence in EU legislation?</h1>
      <p class="subhead">US influence in the EU is at its peak with 314 registered companies actively lobbying
        to shape policies. However, transparency remains a concern: Over the past decade,
        149 of these companies haven't attended any meetings despite spending over 61 million euros on lobbying.</p>

      <p>By <a href="https://github.com/konstantinamalt">Konstantina Maltepioti</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>I have always wondered about the ethics of lobbying, especially when it's performed by big corporations.
      Is it good? Bad? Is it even legal? According to the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/en/transparency/lobby-groups"> European Parliament's page</a> lobbying is not only legal
      but important and a "necessary part of the decision-making process to make sure that EU policies reflect
      people’s real needs". But how often the interests of trillion-dollar companies reflect people's needs?
    </p>
    <p>In 2020, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/big-tech-lobbying-europe.html">leaked document</a> exposing in detail Google's plans to undermine new European legislation
      that could harm its digital advertising business showed how Big Tech companies are using lobbying to halt regulations against them.
    </p>
    <p>Big Tech, which refers to Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft -the largest IT companies in the world-
      is the biggest lobby sector in the EU by spending, ahead of pharma, fossil fuels, finance, and chemicals,
      according to a <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/The%20lobby%20network%20-%20Big%20Tech%27s%20web%20of%20influence%20in%20the%20EU.pdf">report</a> published in 2021 by research group,
      Corporate Europe Observatory. Out of all the companies lobbying the EU on digital policy, 20 percent are US based.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="Top 10 biggest US lobbying spenders.png"
        alt="alt=This is a bar chart showing the money spent by US companies to influence EU legislation and policies in 2023.
        Microsoft is first with 7 million euros, Apple is second with 7 million euros as well, Google is third with 5.5 million euros,
        QUALCOMM is fourth with 4 million, Intel is fifth with 2 million, IBM is sixth with 1.75 million,
        Cisco System is seventh with 1.5 million, Pfizer is eigth with 1.25 million,
        General Electric Company is ninth with 1.24 million, and Amgen is tenth with 1 million euros.">
    </figure>
    <p>Last year, Microsoft declared 7 million euros for lobbying costs sharing the title of the biggest US lobbying spender with Apple.
      Apple has also been the number one spender in 2022 as well, declaring 6.5 million euros in lobbying costs.
      Surprisingly, Microsoft ramped up its spending by 40 percent since 2022, when it declared 5 million euros.
    </p>
    <p>In reality, these numbers are just an estimation, since there is no actual number to measure lobbying activity.
      As of 2021, lobby consultancies are only required to declare their annual revenue from lobbying in very large bracketed thresholds.
      <a href="https://www.lobbyfacts.eu/about">LobbyFacts</a>, a joint project between two research groups, Corporate Europe Observatory and <a href="https://www.lobbycontrol.de/"> Lobby Control </a>,
      takes the minimum number of each bracket and calculates a total for each registrant based on a tally of the individual sums declared per client per year. This makes the figures more precise than the EU Register but according to LobbyFacts "a major under-estimation".
    </p>
    <p>It’s important to keep in mind that the financial declarations are the sole responsibility of each company.
      LobbyFacts warns that if an organization lists one or more EP-accredited lobbyists,
      it may not be probable that its lobbying costs are lower than 10,000 euros, which is the case for some US companies.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="Total lobby costs over a decade_1.png"
        alt="alt=This is a line chart showing the money spent by US companies to influence EU legislation and policies from 2014 to 2023.
        In 2014 the total lobbying costs of all US companies was 24.7 million euros.
        In 2015 it was 38 million. In 2016 it was 48.6 million. In 2017 it was 56.5 million. In 2018 57.1 million.
        In 2019 61.2 million. In 2020 63.4 million. In 2021 61.1 million.
        In 2022 74.5 million euros. In 2023 87.9 million.">
    </figure>
    <p>In the last decade, US companies lobbying the EU are increasing by hundreds while the money spent from their activity is increasing by millions.
      Since 2021, the lobbying costs have risen by 44 percent, while in a four year period from 2017 to 2021, the money spent for lobbying increased only by 8 percent.
      Spending money to advocate for your interest is not bad, since citizens have to make their concerns heard in a way besides elections.
      However, the greater the resources, the greater the influence, meaning that eventually the voices being heard are the ones of big companies.
    </p>
    <p>But where does this money go?

          <p>These are the top spenders over the past decade.
            The money could go goes towards a myriad of tactics, from hiring experienced lobbyists,
            and organizing events to have access to policymakers, to even donating to political parties.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="step" id="step2">
        <p>Out of these 314 companies, 165 have participated in meetings with EU officials.
          The darker shades represent more meetings. Interestingly, some companies reported higher
          lobbying expenditures despite appearing in fewer meetings.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step3">
        <p>While there are 149 companies who have allegedly had no meetings, yet still have spent 61 millions for lobbying.
          20 of them have declared more than 1 million euros in lobbying spending.

    <p>Since December 1, 2014, the European Commission has made public online records of all meetings between Commissioners,
      their Cabinet members, Directors-General, and organizations listed in the register.
      Over the past decade, US companies have been involved in 2,469 of these meetings.
    </p>
    <p>The companies that have appeared in more than a hundred meetings each are Google (368), Microsoft (207),
      IBM Corporation (140), Apple (106), and the General Electric Company (105). However, in reality,
      a registrant company may have had other lobby meetings with lower-level officials in the Commission,
      but the published data -a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/RULES-9-2023-11-01-ANN-01_EN.html">responsibility of EU officials</a>- covers elite officials only.
    </p>
    <p>Big Tech companies have been lobbying Europe's digital economy extensively for years. But their budget is not their only form of power, it’s also their market power.
      Their global monopoly can let them argue that, without political support, jobs will be cut or the tax office will be moved abroad. Professor, Shoshana Zuboff,
      has argued that lobbying has acted as the defense that allowed a business model, built on violating people’s privacy and unfairly dominating the market, to flourish without being challenged.

          <p><strong>Methodology</strong>
            <p><em>Data for the names of the US companies lobbying the EU were downloaded as a CSV file from the EU Transparency Register.
              Data for the companies financial information was collected through scraping the site LobbyFacts,
              by creating the URL for downloading the CSV files of each company based on their registration number
              from the EU Register, storing them in a dataframe and merging them together to conduct the analysis using
              Python. Data for the meetings was also collected and analyzed in the same way.
              LobbyFacts sources: <a href="https://transparency-register.europa.eu/index_el">EU Transparency Register</a> and the <a href="https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/european-commission-meetings-with-interest-representatives?locale=en">European Commission’s data
